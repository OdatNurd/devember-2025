# Devember 2025 - Obsidian plugin

This repository represents my entry into [Devember](https://devember.org/) 2025
and is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin. The ultimate goal, which may
or may not be inside the bounds of this Devember project, is a plugin that is
dedicated to the tooling and support required to help course creators on sites
such as YouTube or Udemy to build and structure course materials, tracking the
course as a whole, what is complete, what is missing etc.

The initial stages of this are going to revolve around reviewing the
[API documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md/Home) in order to
gauge what is possible.
